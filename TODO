#11: owl_client.py as independent package.
@fpierfed opened this issue 4 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    Since it does not depend on any external package, owl_client should really live a life of its own.


#10: Timeouts for database calls.
@fpierfed opened this issue 5 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    Especially in blackboard.py implement a way to timeout database calls that take too long.


#9: Unified logging strategy.
@fpierfed opened this issue 6 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    Implement a unified logging strategy for all pieces of code - including Condor. This strategy will have to involve logging software
    versions and configurations, among other things.


#8: Define unified strategy for handling temporary files.
@fpierfed opened this issue 9 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    Especially in condorutils.py where we create temp files to hold STDOUT, define a strategy for removing these files and/or keeping them
    around in case of errors etc.


#7: Support killing a workflow.
@fpierfed opened this issue 11 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    Implement in condorutils and export via owld a wrapper around condor_rm that kills the DAG condor_dagman job.


#6: Support restarting a rescued workdlow.
@fpierfed opened this issue 12 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    Right now restarting a failed DAG by way of a rescue DAG is possible but only manually. Implement a way to do that via, for instance,
    owld.py


#5: Facitily to hold/release all workflows of a given user and dataset.
@fpierfed opened this issue 14 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    The functionality should be inplemented in condorutils.py and exported to owld.py


#4: Command-line tool to show the blackboard for a given user and dataset.
@fpierfed opened this issue 16 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    This will have to query the blackboard and Condor to find out running jobs associated with a given dataset. It might have to walk the
    DAG.


#2: Ability to create a workflow with an initial given priority.
@fpierfed opened this issue 21 minutes ago. [open]
@fpierfed is assigned.

    It would be useful to be able to specify a priority at workflow creation/submission.
