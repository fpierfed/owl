Process a full ACS association.

This is a simplified version of the HLA ACS pipeline. It does an initial setup 
step where it makes sure that the environment is OK. Then it runs CALACS on each
exposure of the visit in parallel. FInally it runs multidrizzle on the 
calibrated exposures. Its structure is essentially the same as the BCW.

The interesting thing here (and differently from the BCW) is that the meaning of
DATASET changes through the execution of teh workflow. In the case of the first 
and last step (i.e. setup and multidrizzle) DATASET is teh name of the visit. 
For calacs, it is the name of the exposure part of the visit.
